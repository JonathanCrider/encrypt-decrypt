# Lightweight CLI Tool for Encryption and Decryption

This project began as a simple way to encrypt sensitive files while experimenting with shell scripting. It combines my interest in security with the need for efficiency in everyday tasks.

The tool enables you to encrypt and decrypt files from the command line using openssl with AES-256-CBC encryption, PBKDF2 key derivation, and a salt for added security. It's designed as a secure but lightweight solution for sharing sensitive filesâ€”just be sure to follow password and security best practices! (I make no promises or guarantees)

## Future Improvements

This script was written on MacOS running zsh, so you may need to modify the code to run in your specific environment.

In the future, I plan to

- Add compatibility support for other shells (e.g., Bash) by dynamically detecting shells in `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh`
- Enhance error handling for edge cases like missing dependencies (openssl, curl) or invalid arguments
- Unit tests

## Installation

Run the following command in your terminal to install the functions and create sourcing in your `.zshrc` file:

Feel free to check the `install.sh` file before you use this.

```zsh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonathanCrider/encrypt-decrypt/main/install.sh | zsh
```

After installation, be sure to open a new terminal or refresh your `.zshrc` using the following command:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

Pro tip: add an alias (shortcut) for refreshing your terminal.

Copy/paste the command below to add the alias to your `.zshrc` file. You will need to run the command above to use it the first time, or open a new terminal.

```zsh
echo -e "\n# ALIAS to refresh terminal\nalias refresh='source ~/.zshrc'" >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage

Once the code is saved and available (you may need to refresh or open a new terminal window), you have 2 commands:

`encrypt`

`decrypt`

They both take 2 arguments:

  1. path to original file name
  2. path to target file name

### Examples

```bash
# any directory
encrypt ~/path/to/originalfile.txt ~/path/to/encryptedfile.txt

# same directory
encrypt test.txt test-encrypted.txt
```

```bash
# any directory
decrypt ~/path/to/encryptedfile.txt ~/path/to/decryptedfile.txt

# same directory
decrypt test-encrypted.txt test-decrypted.txt
```

## Uninstall

Run the following command to uninstall the script:

```zsh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonathanCrider/encrypt-decrypt/main/uninstall.sh | zsh
```
